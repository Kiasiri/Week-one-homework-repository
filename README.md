# Week-one-homework-repository
### This is my repository for my first homework assignment
##The assignment was to refactor a given html and css file to be more effiecient and less bloated.
-First I broke up the page in a header main and aside and changed their child divs into sections.
-I changed the links in the header to be within a nav element.
-I then changed the css to connect to apply to new new semantic parts instead of the old classes.
-Float right was changed to an id.
-The css now mostly on applies to element tags except for the "float left" class and "float right" id.
